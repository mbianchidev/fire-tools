# PDF Expense / Income Import (Experimental)

The Expense Tracker can read **receipts**, **invoices**, **bank / credit-card statements**, and **payslips** straight from PDF files and turn them into transactions.

This feature is **experimental** and **off by default**. Enable it under **Settings → Experimental Features → PDF expense/income import**.

## How it works

1. You pick one or more PDF files in the *Import PDF* dialog.
2. The PDF is parsed **in your browser** using [`pdfjs-dist`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js). Nothing is uploaded anywhere.
3. Heuristic parsers extract transactions:
   - **Receipt** — single expense with the line marked *Total / Totale / Importo totale / …*
   - **Invoice** — single expense with the *Grand total / Importo totale*
   - **Payslip** — single income with the *Net pay / Importo netto / Stipendio netto / …*
   - **Bank statement** — every line that starts with a date and has an amount becomes a transaction. Negative amounts (or "debit"-style keywords) become expenses; positive amounts (or "credit / stipendio / bonifico in entrata" keywords) become income.
4. Detected transactions land in an **editable review table**. You can:
   - Toggle each row on/off.
   - Change the kind (income ↔ expense).
   - Edit the date, description, amount, category, expense type (need/want) or income source.
5. Confirm to push the included rows into the Expense Tracker. The view jumps to the month of the earliest imported transaction so you immediately see the added rows (a payslip dated in May lands in May, not whichever month you were viewing).

The doc-type dropdown lets you override the auto-detected parser if it picks the wrong one.

## Parsing engine (and the LiteParse experiment)

Text extraction is deliberately decoupled from the heuristic parsers: any engine
that produces the shared `ExtractedPdf` shape (line-grouped text) can feed them.

- **Production (browser):** [`pdfjs-dist`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) in
  `src/utils/pdfTextExtractor.ts`. Runs fully client-side with no native deps.
- **Experimental (Node-only):** [LiteParse](https://github.com/run-llama/liteparse)
  in `src/utils/liteParseExtractor.ts`. LiteParse uses a native PDFium binding, so
  it cannot run in the browser bundle and is loaded dynamically — it is wired up
  for benchmarking and potential desktop/server use, not the web build.

A benchmark test (`tests/pages/expense-tracker/pdfParsingBenchmark.test.ts`) runs a
sample **paystub** and **invoice** (fixtures under `tests/.../fixtures/`, regenerate
with `node tests/pages/expense-tracker/fixtures/generate.mjs`) through *both* engines
and the same heuristics. Both recover the correct doc type, amount and currency; on
these text-layer PDFs LiteParse extracts noticeably faster than pdfjs.

## Optional AI categorization

If a heuristic category is wrong (e.g. an obscure merchant), an **optional** LLM step can re-categorize the rows.

- You provide an **OpenAI-compatible** `/chat/completions` endpoint, an API key, and a model name in *Settings → Experimental Features*.
- Works with **OpenAI**, **Azure OpenAI**, hosted aggregators (**OpenRouter**, **Together**, …), and — most importantly for privacy — **self-hosted open-source models** running locally via **Ollama** (`http://localhost:11434/v1`), **LM Studio** (`http://localhost:1234/v1`), **llama.cpp**, **vLLM**, etc. For local servers, any non-empty API-key value works.
- It only runs when you tick **Use AI categorization** inside the import dialog for that import.
- Only the parsed transaction descriptions, kinds, amounts, and currencies are sent — never the raw PDF bytes.
- If the request fails, times out, or returns invalid JSON, the heuristic results are used unchanged.

### Example endpoints

| Provider     | Base URL                                  | Model example     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| OpenAI       | `https://api.openai.com/v1`               | `gpt-4o-mini`     |
| Azure OpenAI | `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/<deployment>` (append `?api-version=…` as needed) | your deployment id |
| Ollama       | `http://localhost:11434/v1`               | `llama3.1:8b`     |
| LM Studio    | `http://localhost:1234/v1`                | local model id    |
| OpenRouter   | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`            | `openai/gpt-4o-mini` |

## Privacy

- **No PDF bytes ever leave your device.** Parsing happens fully in the browser.
- **No network calls at all** unless you (a) configure the LLM endpoint **and** (b) tick *Use AI categorization* for an import.
- The API key is stored encrypted with the rest of your settings (local SQLite database on desktop, AES-256-encrypted cookie in browser).
- You can clear everything via *Settings → Data Management → Reset All Data*.

## Limitations

Heuristic parsing is intentionally conservative and will never be 100% accurate. Expect to:

- Hand-fix rows highlighted as **low confidence** (light-orange background).
- Override the doc-type dropdown for unusual layouts.
- Edit categories for niche merchants, or use the optional LLM step.

Scanned PDFs (image-only, no text layer) are **not supported**. Run them through an OCR tool first to get a text-bearing PDF.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "No transactions detected" | Wrong doc-type or unusual layout | Pick the correct doc type from the dropdown. |
| All rows have wrong dates | Locale mismatch (DD/MM vs MM/DD) | Edit each row's date manually before confirming. |
| Imported rows seem to vanish after confirming | They belong to a different month than the one you were viewing | The view now auto-jumps to the imported month; use the month/year selector to revisit other periods. |
| LLM categorization does nothing | Endpoint/key not set, or model name wrong | Re-check the three fields in Settings. |
| Build error about `?url` import | Vite version too old | This feature needs Vite 5+ (already pinned in the project). |
