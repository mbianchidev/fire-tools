# Net-worth tracker

A timeline of your total net worth over months and years. Plots the trajectory
and shows you how today's reality compares to the
[FIRE calculator](./fire-calculator.md) projection.

## How to use it

1. **Add a snapshot**: pick a date and enter the total value of each tracked
   account (or import via CSV).
2. Repeat at whatever cadence suits you — monthly is plenty.
3. The chart shows your real progression; the dashed line is the projection
   from the FIRE calculator at the same horizon.

## Why bother?

Tracking net worth turns the FIRE plan from a fantasy into a metric. The
projection in the calculator only matters if your actual numbers are at or
above the trend.

## Export / Import

Snapshots round-trip via CSV so you can keep a backup outside the local store
(SQLite on desktop, encrypted cookies in browser). Use the **Export CSV**
button to grab a snapshot of all entries; use **Import CSV** to restore.
