          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Fire Tools ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal and financial data when you use our Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) planning tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Core Privacy Principle:</strong> Fire Tools is a client-side only application. All your data stays on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your data on our servers because we don't have any servers.

          <h2>3. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
          
          <h3>3.1 Information You Provide</h3>
          <p>
            You may provide the following financial and personal information when using Fire Tools:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Financial data (savings, income, expenses, asset allocation)</li>
            <li>Personal information (year of birth, retirement age)</li>
            <li>Account name or nickname (optional, for personalization)</li>
            <li>Calculator settings and preferences</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>How We Use It:</strong> All data you provide is processed entirely in your web browser to calculate your FIRE projections, run Monte Carlo simulations, and manage your asset allocation. This data never leaves your device.
          </p>

          <h3>3.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>We collect nothing automatically.</strong> We do not use analytics, tracking pixels, or any form of automated data collection. No information about your device, IP address, location, or browsing behavior is collected or transmitted.
          </p>

          <h3>3.3 Information from Third Parties</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>None.</strong> Fire Tools does not integrate with any third-party services that collect data. We do not use social login, authentication providers, payment processors, or any external APIs.
